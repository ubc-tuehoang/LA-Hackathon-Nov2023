# LA-Hackathon-Nov2023

In progress... 

  * Objective: Using a fabricated “FAKE” student record, script initiated requests for recommendations and cross-verification from both Bard AI and OpenAI using Codespaces. This involved assessing and requesting recommendations for the next pathway (ie. which course/s to take next based on student’s performance), considering the students’ current grades. The entire process was iteratively executed for around 10 iterations.
